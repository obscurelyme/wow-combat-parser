## The Design

---

![Design Document](uml-design-doc.png)

---

## Monorepo

--

Contains all source code in a single location

--

Including this very presentation

--

Loosely coupled dependencies

---

## Dry Run

NodeJS Command Line Application

```bash
node ./parse-logs.js ./log.txt
```

| Pros                      | Cons                         |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------- |
| Super fast iteration time | No UI ðŸ˜”                     |
|                           | Loads of missing information |
